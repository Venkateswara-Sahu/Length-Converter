# Length Converter

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that converts lengths between different units using Python's Tkinter library.

## Features
- Converts length entered in meters to the following units:
  - Kilometers (km)
  - Millimeters (mm)
  - Centimeters (cm)
  - Miles (mile)
  - Yards (yard)
  - Inches (inch)
  - Feet (foot)
  - Decimeters (dm)
- User-friendly interface with an option to exit the application.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. The code uses Tkinter, which is bundled with standard Python installations, so no additional external libraries are needed.
